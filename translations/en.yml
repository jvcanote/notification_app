* Easily notify a group of agents or all the agents signed into your Zendesk account

* Share pictures, links, or other useful or fun resources

* Proactively let agents know important information about their work


Description:


The Notification app enables Zendesk administrators to broadcast messages to some or all of your agents. For example, quickly let your team know about an outage or easily invite the team out to lunch.  Simply open the app, type a message, select the group, and click send. The app will pop open and display messages to all signed-in agents in real time.  Messages history is stored in the app until they sign out of Zendesk.


Use the Notification app to keep the company apprised of critical information, real-time.
